Week 1
Selected group mates and submitted our preferences for what project aligned with our interests
and skills. As a group we discussed what tech stack would be applicable within the project of 
interest. 

Week 2
Made a Jira acocunt and joined the Jira team. Also accessed the team github repository and attended 
the meeting with the client. The project selected was project 23. I finished my portion of the user 
stories and I was allocated to work on the Professional User storyboard.
