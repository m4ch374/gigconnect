Week 1
We formed and named our group. I volunteered as Scrum Master. We discussed
our project preferences and skills/experience. We also brainstormed the
possible tech stack we could use for the project. We planned to start the
proposal in the next week.

Week 2
We decided to do P23 and started work on the proposal. I researched and
wrote the background section for the proposal. We had further
discussions on the tech stack and assigned frontend/backend roles.
We planned to finish the rest of the proposal before next tutorial, so we
could get feedback from the tutor.

Week 3
We continued work on the proposal and finalised the tech stack for our
project. I wrote the project objectives and novel functionality section
of the proposal. We got feedback from the tutor and then submitted our
proposal after making some changes. We planned to finalise our API
and database schema in the next few days, so that we could start
coding in week 4.
